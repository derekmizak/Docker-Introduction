# Exercise 1: Create and Use a Named Volume

## Objective
- Learn to create and attach a named volume to a container.
- Observe data persistence by restarting and stopping the container.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Named Volume
1. Create a named volume:
   ```bash
   docker volume create my-named-volume
   ```

2. Verify that the volume was created:
   ```bash
   docker volume ls
   ```

---

### Step 2: Run a Container with the Named Volume
1. Start a container with the volume:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name volume-test -v my-named-volume:/data alpine
   ```

2. Inside the containerâ€™s shell, create a file in the `/data` directory:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello from Container A" > /data/file.txt
   ```

3. Exit the container:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

---

### Step 3: Verify Data Persistence After Stopping the Container
1. Stop the container:
   ```bash
   docker stop volume-test
   ```

2. Confirm the container has stopped:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

3. Inspect the volume data directly on the Docker-managed file system:
   - First, locate the volume's mount path:
     ```bash
     docker volume inspect my-named-volume
     ```
   - Look for the `"Mountpoint"` field in the output, which shows where the volume is stored on the host (e.g., `/var/lib/docker/volumes/my-named-volume/_data`).

4. Navigate to the volume's mount point on the host and list its contents:
   ```bash
   ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/my-named-volume/_data
   ```

5. View the content of the file:
   ```bash
   cat /var/lib/docker/volumes/my-named-volume/_data/file.txt
   ```

---

### Step 4: Restart the Container and Verify Data
1. Restart the container:
   ```bash
   docker start -i volume-test
   ```

2. Inside the container, check the `/data` directory to confirm the file still exists:
   ```bash
   cat /data/file.txt
   ```

3. Exit the container:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

---

## Expected Outcome
- Students will observe that:
  1. Data persists in the Docker-managed volume directory on the host even when the container is stopped.
  2. Restarting the container allows access to the same data without any loss.

---

## Notes
- The ability to persist data in volumes ensures reliability across container lifecycles.
- Be cautious when accessing Docker-managed volume directories directly on the host, as unintended changes could affect container behavior.
